# Technical notes for data-mining

## GraphQL APIs

* We have learned that Wikifactory uses GraphQL for their data API. At time of writing, they've said they'll send us some information on how to access that API.
* The GraphQL project has an official implementation of a [GraphQL "IDE"](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) that helps you construct queries. This may aid us in using GraphQL in our scripts.
* [Official GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/) for reference.
